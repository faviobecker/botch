# botch

quick botch to convert some csv data into output, which can be copy and pasted into a JSON backup

## background

We were faced with manually adding entities to our chatbot agent. This would have meant a manual entry for each car brand available for purchase in the UK.

Setting up a solution would have taken too long for the deadline of our POC, so I wrote this python script to convert the entries of a CSV file into a plain txt output that could me copy & pasted into a JSON, in the right format, without the need for further editing.
